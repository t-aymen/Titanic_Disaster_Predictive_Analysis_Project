# Titanic Disaster - Exploratory & Predictive Analysis

## Context and Scope

This analysis project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the survivability rate of passengers abroad the infamous Titanic.

<b>About the incident</b>

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
